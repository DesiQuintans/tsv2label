#' Label, describe, rename, and factorise datasets using a data dictionary
#'
#' This package lets you describe and label datasets from human-readable data
#' dictionaries in the form of tab-separated spreadsheets (`.TSV` or `.TXT`).
#' This format is ideal because it can be hand-edited in Excel; can be built
#' by copying and pasting from existing messy data dictionaries; can be cleaned
#' and reshaped with regular expressions; and can be committed, tracked, and
#' diffed in version control software. `tsv2label` supports variable labels,
#' variable renaming, and value labelling (through automatic conversion to
#' Factor). It modifies dataframes in-place, making it suitable for large data.
#'
#' For a thorough introduction to the package, including what the dictionary
#' files should actually look like and how they should be stored, see
#' [`the online readme on Github`](https://github.com/DesiQuintans/tsv2label)..
