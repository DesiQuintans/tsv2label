# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

- CHANGED
    - `factor_file` and `factorise_with_dictionary()` are no longer picky about users giving filenames *without* extensions. It just chops off  *.tsv* and *.txt* extensions if they're present in `factor_file`.

## 0.10.0 (2023-03-25)

- Initial commit and release
