Title: Factorise, Label, and Rename Datasets Using Plain Text Data Dictionaries
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Desi Quintans
Maintainer: Desi Quintans <science@desiquintans.com>
Description: Analysts know that datasets can come with cryptic column names, and 
   that their data dictionaries come in many forms that are not suitable for 
   programmatic use; as 'PDFs', in 'Word' documents, in emails, or in other 
   people's code fragments. It is common to work through a messy dictionary by 
   copying and pasting text into a spreadsheet. 'tsv2label' lets you use such 
   spreadsheets (as tab-separated '.TSV' or '.TXT' files) to recode, label, 
   and rename datasets. This format is ideal because it can be hand-edited in 
   'Excel'; can be built by copying and pasting from any data source; can be 
   cleaned and reshaped with regular expressions and multiple cursors; and can 
   be committed, tracked, and diffed in version control software. 'tsv2label' 
   supports variable labels, variable renaming, and value labelling (through 
   automatic conversion to Factor). It modifies dataframes in-place, making 
   it suitable for large data.
