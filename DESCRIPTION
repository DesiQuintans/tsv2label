Title: Label, describe, rename, and factorise datasets using a data dictionary
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Desi Quintans
Maintainer: Desi Quintans <science@desiquintans.com>
Description: This package lets you describe and label datasets from 
   human-readable data dictionaries in the form of tab-separated spreadsheets 
   (.TSV or .TXT). This format is ideal because it can be hand-edited in Excel; 
   can be built by copying and pasting from existing messy data dictionaries; 
   can be cleaned and reshaped with regular expressions; and can be committed, 
   tracked, and diffed in version control software. tsv2label supports
   variable labels, variable renaming, and value labelling (through automatic
   conversion to Factor). It modifies dataframes in-place, making it suitable
   for large data.
