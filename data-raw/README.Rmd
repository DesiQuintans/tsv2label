If you've ever tried to find your way through a dataset with cryptic names and values, you've probably made a spreadsheet that had columns like: 1) variable name, 2) what it contains, 3) what its types are, especially if it looks like they are coding for something.

`tsv2label` lets you use such a spreadsheet to label, rename, and factorise your dataset automatically; especially helpful if your dataset is hundreds of columns wide.

It uses tab-delimited spreadsheets which are editable in Excel; easy to assemble by copying and pasting from existing messy data dictionaries; can be cleaned and reshaped with regular expressions and multiple cursors; and can be tracked and diffed with version control software.

# List of functions

`tsv2label` gives you four main functions:

| Function                              | Description                            |
|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| `factorise_with_dictionary(df, path)` | Convert variables to Factor            |
| `describe_with_dictionary(df, path)`  | Add descriptions (labels) to variables |
| `rename_with_dictionary(df, path)`    | Rename variables                       |
|                                       |                                        |
| `revert_colnames(df, path)`           | Return columns to their original names |

## Order of operations {#order}

The order that these functions should be applied is:

1. `factorise_with_dictionary()`
2. `describe_with_dictionary()`
3. `rename_with_dictionary()`
4. `revert_colnames()`

This is because when `factorise_with_dictionary()` converts variables to Factors, any labels associated with them are lost. And when `rename_with_dictionary()` renames variables, `factorise_with_dictionary()` and `describe_with_dictionary()` can no longer find and act on them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Example: Describing the Poker Hands dataset

## The raw data

```{r}
library(tsv2label)
```

`tsv2label` ships with a built-in dataset called `poker`, which is a subset of the [Poker Hand](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand) dataset with some added columns:

```{r}
head(poker)
```

There are many coded values here that need to be converted to Factors. The column names are cryptic, and the dataset has no variable labels which would aid in exploration, especially when using a label-aware exploration package like [`siftr`](https://github.com/DesiQuintans/siftr/).

Luckily, `tsv2label` ships with the data dictionary for this dataset, in both .ZIP and folder forms (`tsv2label` can read directly from both):

```{r}
# system.file() looks inside tsv2label's installed location to see the files 
# that came with it. 

system.file("extdata", package = "tsv2label") |> list.files()
```


## What does a dictionary look like?

A data dictionary is a directory or .ZIP file with no subfolders, which contains tab-delimited spreadsheets in either *.TSV* or *.TXT* format.

```{r}
system.file("extdata/poker", package = "tsv2label") |> list.files()
```

The Appendix below has the [formal definition of a dictionary](#formal-definition-of-a-tsv2label-data-dictionary), but the easiest way to understand what should be in a dictionary is by looking at `poker`'s.

### Index file

The central file is called `index`; it must always exist, and must be a tab-delimited file in *.TSV* or *.TXT* format.

```{r}
system.file("extdata/poker/index.tsv", package = "tsv2label") |> read.delim()
```

It must have these four columns in any order (all other columns are ignored):

1.  `name` is the name of a column/variable in your dataset.
2.  `rename` is what to rename the column. Leave it blank if unneeded.
3.  `description` is a human-readable description of what the variable is about. Leave it blank if unneeded.
4.  `factor_file` is used to convert categorical data into Factors. It has the filename (with or without file extension) of a spreadsheet in the same folder that describes how levels are mapped to labels, e.g. postal codes to suburb names. As you can see, one `factor_file` can be applied to many columns.


### Factor files

The factor files control how a variable is going to be converted to a Factor type. Factor files must also be tab-delimited files in *.TSV* or *.TXT* format.

```{r}
system.file("extdata/poker/values_suits.tsv", package = "tsv2label") |> read.delim()
```

It must have these three columns in any order (other columns are ignored):

1.  `levels` contains the raw values in your dataset. It is used as the levels of the new factor.
2.  `labels` contains the label to apply to each level.
3.  `ordered` controls whether this will be created as an ordered factor. An affirmative value (case-insensitive: `true`, `t`, `yes`, `y`, or `1`) in *any* cell of this column will make it an ordered factor.

The columns are named after their matching arguments in `factor()`:

```{r}
str(factor)
```


## Reading a dictionary

`tsv2label` can read dictionaries from both folders and .ZIP files. The latter is particularly convenient because it lets you distribute a dictionary as a single .ZIP file.

`tsv2label` functions have a `path` argument to tell them where the dictionary is:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# To read from a folder, use the path to the folder:
factorise_with_dictionary(df = my_data, path = "C:/path/to/dictionary/folder")

# To read from a .ZIP, use the path to the .ZIP (it will unzip automatically):
factorise_with_dictionary(df = my_data, path = "C:/path/to/my_dictionary.zip")
```

For this example, let's read the dictionary from the folder.

```{r}
dictionary_dir <- system.file("extdata/poker", package = "tsv2label")
dictionary_dir
```

If you were using your own data dictionary, then this would be a path to its location on your computer.


## Step 1: Convert categorical variables to Factors

Converting to Factor always comes first in our [order of operations](#order-of-operations).

```{r}
factorise_with_dictionary(df = poker, path = dictionary_dir)
```

Note that we didn't have to assign the result to a name; all `tsv2label` functions avoid expensive copying by modifying the dataframe in-place.

Any column that had a `factor_file` associated with it in `index` will be converted to a Factor:

```{r}
head(poker)
```

## Step 2: Add labels/descriptions to variables

Adding variable labels comes next. These are used by many R packages to add extra functionality. For example, RStudio can display labels in `View()`, the [`gtsummary` package](https://github.com/ddsjoberg/gtsummary) uses the label attribute to name variables in its output tables where possible, and my [`siftr` package](https://github.com/DesiQuintans/siftr/) allows you to search the labels (among all other text in each variable) to find the right variable in large datasets.

```{r}
describe_with_dictionary(df = poker, path = dictionary_dir)
```

All columns except `LIST_COL` (which was not in the dictionary) had a `description` in `index`, so all of them have a new `"label"` attribute:

```{r}
Map(\(x) attr(x, "label"), poker)
```

## Step 3: Rename variables

Finally, we can rename the variables based on the `rename` column in `index`.

```{r}
rename_with_dictionary(df = poker, path = dictionary_dir)
```

The `CAT` column did *not* have a `rename` associated with it in `index`, so it was not renamed. The `LIST_COL` column was not in the dictionary at all, so it is also unchanged.

```{r}
colnames(poker)
```

You can also revert the names, which is useful if you make changes to the data dictionary and want to go back to Step 1.

```{r}
revert_colnames(df = poker, path = dictionary_dir)

colnames(poker)
```

# Appendix

## Formal definition of a `tsv2label` data dictionary {#formal}

The keywords **REQUIRED/MUST**, **MUST NOT**, and **MAY/OPTIONAL** are interpreted according to [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). I add an extra keyword, **IGNORED**, for clarity about what `tsv2label` will permit.

-   REQUIRED/MUST and MUST NOT are absolute requirements, or else the software will throw errors.
-   MAY or OPTIONAL are elements that you can leave out if not needed.
-   IGNORED are things that tsv2label does not attempt to access or use.

'Variable' and 'column' are used interchangeably; they refer to a column of a dataframe object.

### File structure

`tsv2label`'s functions take a `path` argument, which we will call the *dictionary path*. This path:

-   **MUST** be the path to a directory or a .ZIP file.
-   The *dictionary path* **MUST** contain a file called `index.tsv` or `index.txt` in its root folder.
-   Subfolders in the *dictionary path* are **IGNORED**.
-   Files in the *dictionary path* that are not `.tsv` or `.txt` format are **IGNORED**.
-   Files that are not called `index.tsv` or `index.txt`, and are not referenced in the `factor_file` variable of `index` (see below), are **IGNORED**.

### Contents of `index` file

-   `index` **MUST** be a tab-delimited spreadsheet. You can get this from Excel by saving your spreadsheet as *"Text (Tab delimited) (.txt)"*. .TXT files are recognised by `tsv2label`, so you do not have to change its extension.
-   `index` **MUST** have these columns: `name`, `rename`, `description`, and `factor_file`.
    -   `name` --- The name of a variable in your dataframe.
        -   **MUST NOT** be left blank.
        -   **MUST** exactly match a variable's name.
        -   **MAY** be the name of a variable that doesn't exist in the dataframe. This means that you can pre-name a variable that you expect to be creating in the future.
    -   `rename` --- What to rename the variable.
        -   **MAY** be left blank. This means that the variable will not be renamed.
        -   If not blank, **MUST** be a [syntactically valid name](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/make.names.html) in R.
    -   `description` --- Description of what the variable contains or is about. Also known as 'variable labels'. Used to fill the `"label"` attribute of the variable.
        -   **MAY** be left blank. This means that the variable will not be described.
    -   `factor_file` --- The filename of a spreadsheet in the *dictionary path* that describes how the variable's values are mapped to labels, e.g. postal codes to place names. These are also known as 'value labels'. These are used to convert the variable to a Factor type.
        -   **MAY** be left blank. This means that the variable will not be converted to a Factor.
        -   If not blank, **MUST** exactly match the filename of a file in the *dictionary path*.
        -   All factor files that are named here **MUST** exist.
        -   **MAY** be given with or without a file extension; it is assumed to point to a `.tsv` or `.txt` file.
        -   More than one `name` **MAY** share the same `factor_file`.

### Contents of `factor_file` files

If defined for a variable in the `factor_file` column of `index`:

-   **MUST** be in the *dictionary path*, and exactly match the name given in the `factor_file` column.
-   **MUST** be a tab-delimited spreadsheet in either *.tsv* or *.txt* format.
-   **MUST** have these columns in any order: `levels`, `labels`.
    -   `levels` --- Values in the variable.
    -   `labels` --- Labels to apply to each level.
-   **MAY** have this column in any order: `ordered`.
    -   `ordered` --- Should this be created as an ordered factor?
        -   If the column is missing, an unordered factor is created.
        -   If the column is present but all cells are blank, an unordered factor is created.
        -   An ordered factor is created if the column is present **and** at least one cell in the column contains one of (case-insensitive) `true`, `t`, `yes`, `y`, or `1`.
            -   You **MAY** fill out just one cell in this column and leave the rest blank.
-   The columns above are passed into the `factor()` function to do the conversion, and therefore must meet the expectations of that function, namely:
    -   Each `level` entry **MUST** exactly match a value in the variable.
    -   There **SHOULD** be a `level` entry for each unique value in the variable. Values without a matching `level` entry will be coded as `NA` by `factor()`.
    -   There **MUST** be a `label` for every `level`. 
        - `label`s **MAY** be duplicated to bin different levels under the same label. 
    -   Levels are created in the order they are listed.
